Format: [1m/substitute [0m{[1;35mtext pattern[0m} {[1;35mreplacement text[0m} {[1;35mgroup name[0m}

A substitute looks for text patterns in the same way that an action does. When
it finds a match it substitutes the text in the pattern with the replacement
text. 

If you use one or more pattern wildcards like %0 you can then use the matching
system variables like $0 as well as other variables in the replacement string

   þ {[1;35mtext pattern[0m} The text to substitute.
   þ {[1;35mreplacement text[0m} The text to display.
   þ {[1;35mgroup name[0m} This is an optional parameter. See the user guide for help on
     groups.
