ArrayCopy lets you copy arrays and their contents into a new array.

   þ {[1;35marray name[0m} The name of the existing array.
   þ {[1;35mcopy name[0m}  The name of the new array which is a copy of the existing array.
   þ {[1;35mgroup name[0m} This is optional, see the user guide for help with groups.

Example:

/arraycopy [0m{[1;35mRegexSubMatches[0m} {[1;35mMatchedText[0m} {[1;35mMyArrays[0m}
This would create an array called MatchedText which is a copy of the RegexSubMatches array
at that time.
